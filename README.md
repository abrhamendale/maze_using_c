Build your portfolio project (Week 1): Making Progress
Project: Maze

2. Challenges
The first challenge I noticed was that the ray casting process is very difficult to program. I read different methods, and although I’m beginning to understand how it works it took a long time for me. Once, I overcome that challenge, the other difficulty I had to deal with is actually installing SDL and using it. I am working on Win10 WSL and it took a lot of effort from me to realize that it was not possible to run windows from within WSL terminal in Win10.So, I did some searching and found that the window can be redirected to another application running on windows 10 called “VcXsrv”. I installed the software and still it could not connect or when it did it did not have a video device to render to. Hence, I found an linux application called “startxfce4” that turns the WSL terminal environment into a virtual machine like environment with support for rendering. After I installed the app, I could now render graphics by running c codes from bash.

3. Collaboration
Although I am working alone in the Maze project I have tried to get help from peers and from what others have experienced in similar projects. Especially, I have obtained valuable information from the internet. I will subsequently try to add more collaboration since it is better.

4. Project updates
I have not changed any of the project deliverables since I have not encountered any issues that cannot be surmounted.

1. Progress
I have made a lot of progress this week because I was able to understand the different ways of ray casting. However, I think I should have at the same time tried to learn better about c graphics programs. So, I would rate my progress 8/10. This is justified because most of the difficulty in programming the maze is on how the game works an a little about the graphics. At this rate, I think I will complete most of the project on time.
